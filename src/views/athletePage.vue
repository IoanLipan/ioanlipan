        I like to keep my mind and my body in shape. This helps me reach my maximum potential.
        There is a saying: <span class="underline">Mens sano in corpore sano</span>.
        If problem-solving keeps the brain active and healthy, the same is with sports and the body.
        Nowadays, most of the people are negligent towards their body, especially programmers. The
        body reacts to what it is doing most of the time. Having a
        <span class="underline">sedentary job</span> and 10+ hours of screentime should not be
        a motivation to adopt a <span>sedentary lifestyle</span>. In order to compensate for the
        physical inactivity of my job, I play every sport that I can, whenever I have the occasion.
